Project repository link: https://github.com/ChaosWaffle1/AIMBOT.git <br>

<p>This game was built using the Windows version of Godot ver. 4.4.1. The full project is accessible through the game engine by opening the project.godot file in the linked repository, or play-only by opening the aimbot_v5 executable in this directory.</p>

<p>Work on this project spanned half a semester in the Game Development Process course at WPI.
The objective was to build a complete game with a team of four, which resulted in AIMBOT.</p>
<p>AIMBOT is a 2D shooter where you control the hero, whose goal is to destroy the robots using ricocheting bullets as you progress through each puzzle. </p>
<p>This was my first experience creating a game in an academic environment and with a team. However, in our respective roles (I was a programmer), we handled this project very well, successfully creating a simple yet entertaining experience.</p>
